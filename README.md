# Reinforcement Learning for Sim-to-Real transfer - MLDL (2023/2024)

This work is the result of a project of the Machine Learning and Deep Learning course at Politecnico di Torino.
The main objective of this work is the analysis of various Reinforcement Learning algorithms and of the Sim-to-Real transfer problem for the Hopper environment, concluding with the implementation of Automatic Domain Randomization, a state-of-the-art technique designed by OpenAI researchers.
