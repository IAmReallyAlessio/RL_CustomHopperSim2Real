This work is the result of the project of the Machine Learning and Deep Learning course at Politecnico di Torino.
I worked with Francesco Giannuzzo and Abdessamed Qchohi on the analysis of various Reinforcement Learning algorithms and on the Sim-to-Real transfer problem for the Hopper environment, concluding with the implementation of Automatic Domain Randomization, a state-of-the-art technique designed by OpenAI researchers.
